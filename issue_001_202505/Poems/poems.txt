UNSNOWED  DAWN

by Evortexio Axleron

Leaving the hall was the last lamp, 
It made its way through belated darkness. 
Patterns on the flag were falling in their sighs. 
In its sorrow was the air's tramp
And a sallow firmament by the end of a slype
Like in a meadow the sheep wears. 
Gray branches murmured in their advance. 
Winds subsided. Dust stopped its hurried step. 

A black bowler tumbled on the lane de brick, 
Repeating magicians' jugglery that was boring, 
Like from the clouds a bird sank
On the arid wavy land it was floating. 
Suddenly it rang, with brightness's flick
Which was diamond dusts dropping into gasping.

A LEAF OF LETTER

by Evortexio Axleron

An uncovered letter bent its shape, 
Hobbling its way on the desktop
With steady breath far away
And secrets not to say. 

He came. 
The letter shook with dust fallen afloat, 
Glowing in heat wave it was bright
When yellowish wrinkles discolored into pale white.

AFTER THE SKY

by Evortexio Axleron

Black and white entwines among the cups, 
In which coffee gambols
As the fish's tremor in the mid of lake
Reflecting damp shape on the lantern wick. 

Snowflakes hesitate by their descent, 
Crunching along a line beneath leaving boots. 
Wind plays the fingers von die Welt, 
Fondling on the ice with her scuffs. 

Clouds vanish into the backdrop. 
And overflown moonlight soaks treetop. 
It dissolves in teal of inverted lago
Before it turns into il sedim√©nto.
